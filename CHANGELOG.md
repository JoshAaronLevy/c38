## Pre-Meeting Notes

- Need SSL cert for the website [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/)

### Home Page

- Add hover effects to home page cards
- Set up the newsletter signup form and storage

### Store

- Since this is hosted by Square, can it be integrated into existing site? Or does it have to be external?

### Memberships

- Should include a link or button to `Events`, in case someone visited the page looking for single game tickets
- Info about each section should be above the list (perhaps a smaller version without photos), just so visitors can see the difference before looking at ticket options
- This page isn't bad, but definitely could use some TLC to make more user-friendly. For instance, having the different section info at the top, with `View Memberships` under each, which then displays the options for that specific section, is a more clean interface and simpler user experience

### Media Hub

- Missing Page Header
- Images/Cards should also be links (not just the buttons)

### About Us

- Text paragraphs should have block background, instead of line background
